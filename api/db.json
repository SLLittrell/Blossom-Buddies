Dill attracts tomato hornworm.Growing tomatoes with Basil does not appear to enhance tomato flavour but studies have shown that growing them around 10 inches apart can increase the yield of tomatoes by about 20%. One study shows that growing chili peppers near tomatoes in greenhouses increases tomato whitefly on the tomatoes.\n"
